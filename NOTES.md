# Habitat Energy Coding Challenge

## Setup instructions

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Any framework/library choices you made and why
**Frontend Framework:** I used Angular due to my familiarity with the framework and because of how full-featured it is.
**UI Library:** I initially was just using pure CSS so I can customize to my liking; however, I quickly realized that
due to the complexity, I realized that in order to achieve the clean and clear visuals I was hoping for, I should use an
existing design system. After researching design systems that work well with Angular, I landed on PrimeNG. It's simple
to use and produces clean and elegant UI.

### What you would improve given more time
Normally, I would spend days reviewing each component fully before commiting any code. However, in order to satisfy the
requirements, make it "look good", and keep it under ~6 hours, I had to balance how thoroughly I was reviewing code generated by the AI agent.
I was very involved in the planning process with the AI and provided strong direction. 

In a real-life setting, I would probably spend a couple of weeks planning out the architecture, data flow, data store,
services, validators, UI layout, etc.

However, this was still a fun challenge due to the requirements and data backend data provided. The AI agent suggested a 
5 second polling method to assimilate "real-time" metrics, however, I would be interested in a more elegant web socket
solution.

I will admit that I did not review any of the generated unit tests; however, I decided to leave then in the codebase
to help identify regressions during the development process. 

I also wanted to emulate as close as possible how this system would be structured in a real and large codebase so I used the folder structure
that I used at my previous role.


### Any assumptions or decisions you made
I was not exactly sure how to display the telemetry data. The directions mentioned showing data "selected asset(s)".
I debated whether this should be part of the assets list or standalone. Ultimately, I decided that if you're selecting
assets, you may want to compare values, hence why I came up with the side by side card view.
